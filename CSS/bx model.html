    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <p>The box model is a concept in CSS that describes the structure of an HTML element as a rectangular box.</p>
    <p>The box model consists of the following parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content area: This is the area where the content of the element is displayed.</li>
        <li>Padding: This is the space between the content area and the border of the element.</li>
        <li>Border: This is the visible border of the element.</li>
        <li>Margin: This is the space between the element and other elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The box model is used to calculate the total width and height of an element, as well as its position on the page.</p>
    <div class="box">This is a div element with a box model.</div>
