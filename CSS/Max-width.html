    <h1>CSS Max-width</h1>
    <p>This page is just about CSS max-width, explained simply.</p>
    <div class="max-width">
        <p>This div has a max-width of 500px. It will not get any wider than 500px even if the content inside it is wider than that.</p>
        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_logo_white.png" alt="W3Schools Logo" width="600px">
    </div>
    <p>As you can see, the div above does not get any wider than 500px even though the image inside it is wider than that. This is because of the max-width property.</p>
